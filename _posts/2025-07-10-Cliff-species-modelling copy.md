Species Distribution modelling (SDM) is a powerful tool to understand the distribution of species in a given area, and it can be used to inform conservation efforts, especially for species that are threatened or endangered. In this post, I will discuss how we used Random Forests (RF) to model the distribution of cliff species in Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain.

<small>[The Next Rembrandt](https://www.jwt.com/en/work/thenextrembrandt) is a computer-generated 3-D–printed painting developed by a facial-recognition algorithm that scanned data from 346 known paintings by the Dutch painter in a process lasting 18 months. The portrait is based on 168,263 fragments from Rembrandt’s works.</small> -->
